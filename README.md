# Master thesis: WebAssembly Binary Security (2024-2025)
## Description
This GitHub repository contains some of the codes used throughout my research, to either understand concepts or prove my observations.
>[!note]
> This repository does not represent the entierity of my research codebase. Many other programs were made but were deemed to be either redundant to some already present in this repo, or considered as failed attempts of me trying to puzzel things out or trying to make some things work (but could not).
