# Master thesis: WebAssembly Binary Security (2024-2025)
## Description
This GitHub repository contains some of the codes used throughout my research, to either understand concepts or prove my observations.
>[!note]
> This repository does not represent the entirety of my research codebase. Many other programs were created, but were either deemed redundant due to the presence of similar programs in this repository, or were considered failed attempts at solving problems or making things work (skill issue or simply not possible).
